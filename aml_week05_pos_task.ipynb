You can just overwrite them with tf.assign.\n","  * When using pre-trained embeddings, pay attention to the fact that model's dictionary is different from your own.\n","  * You may want to switch trainable=False for embedding layer in first few epochs as in regular fine-tuning.  \n","* __More efficient batching__: right now TF spends a lot of time iterating over \"0\"s\n","  * This happens because batch is always padded to the length of a longest sentence\n","  * You can speed things up by pre-generating batches of similar lengths and feeding it with randomly chosen pre-generated batch.\n","  * This technically breaks the i.i.d. assumption, but it works unless you come up with some insane rnn architectures.\n","* __Structured loss functions__: since we're tagging the whole sequence at once, we might as well train our network to do so.\n","  * There's more than one way to do so, but we'd recommend starting with [Conditional Random Fields](http://blog.echen.me/2012/01/03/introduction-to-conditional-random-fields/)\n","  * You could plug CRF as a loss function and still train by backprop. There's even some neat tensorflow [implementation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/contrib.crf) for you.\n"]}]}
